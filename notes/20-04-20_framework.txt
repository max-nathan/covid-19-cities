## Motivation 

Q: is Coronavirus 'the dark side of cities'? 
Q: what does this imply for cities in the recovery period? 

Cross country: little or not relation between #cities, density and CV19 cases

https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1249821717641531392?s=11

BUT widespread assumption that 'density is the enemy' by many urbanists and commentators 
e.g. Glaeser: https://www.city-journal.org/cities-and-pandemics-have-long-history#.Xpzo4L818VU.twitter
e.g. takes in this CityLab piece: https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2020/04/coronavirus-cases-urban-density-suburbs-health-parks-cities/610210/
e.g. all the other articles in that thread you collected 

Note the historical resonances with cities ~ unhealthy tropes [CityLab piece]
Prejudice ... but also underlying point that cities have diseconomies of agglomeration too and that includes diseases
... point = is this true now? 


Debate about which parts of cities, density vs public transport vs connectivity etc

But at least four other (less urbanist) takes on this: 
 
1/ Demographic - older people are more vulnerable, younger people might spread it more 
2/ Economic - places with more 'exposed' occupations [face to face, can't work at home and/or less employment protection] are more vulnerbale 
3/ Inequality - relatedly, places with more people in a) low-paid exposed jobs b) crowded housing c) public transport dependent

https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/virus-hitting-hardest-modern-equivalent-victorian-slums

These takes are - broadly - less about blaming urban spaces [and sometimes, people in them] than about the urbanised economic / social processes that produce these conditions. 

And related to that ... 

4/ State / Public policy: in particular, a) public healthcare b) state capacity ~ austerity c) lack of leadership and d) speed / extent of lockdown

This paper: 

* Focuses on local areas - cities, towns and rural places - in England 
* Statics on cases, growth in cases vs urban / demographic / economic chars, and links to deprivation and inequality 
* Dynamics, linking cases, changes in mobility and urban chars
* Urban vs non-urban characteristics 


Caution 1: 
* associations, not causal 
* idea is to look at patterns and assess a) explanatory power b) how far they are consistent with explanations advanced
* but this is hard to do. Kolko 2020: 

"Density is correlated with metro size, college attainment, partisanship, transit usage, international air passengers — so it’s hard to pin down which mechanisms really matter. Some variables are very highly correlated, which makes them impossible to distinguish as explanations. For instance, the share of a county’s workers in occupations in which working-from-home is possible has a .95 correlation with county share with bachelor’s degree."

"It’s tempting to include local stay-at-home orders and physical distancing measures in these simple models to see how they affect death rates. But the local order and distancing behaviors aren’t random – and are probably as much a reaction to expected health outcomes as a cause of actual health outcomes. They deserve serious policy analysis, and quick & dirty regressions can’t do them justice."


Caution 2: 
* measurement error 
Best measure of spread = 100% testing and share of positive tests

* PHE data on confirmed cases at hospitals - actual number of cases (e.g. in homes, in care homes) may be much higher 
* Focus on spread of cases rather than deaths 

UK doesn't test everyone and don't provide info on #tests locally - so potentially big measurement error [undercounting of real number of cases, see caution 2; but also overcounting in cities if people in cities find it easier to / are more willing to get to a hospital]

Furth 2020: "In an ongoing crisis with a shortage of tests, all infection and mortality data come with a major asterisk: we do not fully know the extent of the data. Only when all-cause mortality data and more-extensive testing data are available can any conclusions be confirmed. This study, like Harris’ and others, is subject to potentially massive measurement error."

Preview of results: 

* graph cases over time: English 'urban story' is a London story, vs other city-regions:  
	* total cases in London ~ rest of England, less biggest city-regions  
	* average London LA has much higher cases than average LAs in rest of England, or other city-regions 

* graph differences within cities too:
	* show the breakdown of case growth within example city-region, e.g. GM vs London [different parts of the city]

* scatters: spread is about popdensity but also the things that density generates: 
	* public transport, hh size do as good a job as density - and are closely related 
	* occupational mix; % essential workers  

* OLS/binscatters: case-density relationship weakens over time 
		!! pop density becomes less important 
		<= b/c people in cities react faster to the virus ~ links to occupation and industry structures
		[CFC evidence on speed of lockdown]
		[Goodier and Ryman citylab piece]

* NB these interrelationships are hard to model 
	* binscatters with controls 
	* you can make it go away if you dump a load of controls in 
	* BUT of course these are all collinear to each other => tells us it's more complex than density alone


What do we learn: 

* Not just 'the dark side of density'

- global cities vs all other cities 
		<=> GVCs and supply chains [cf Mike Davis]

- Popdensity vs finer-grained measures 

- Household and labour market structures 
	- hh and family structures, e.g. multigenerational households * BAME * frontline work [Guardian piece]
	- occupation structures: how exposed is your work, how far can you work at home, how much protection you have ~ responses you can make 
	
- Feedback mechanisms 

- national differences / political economy 
	- response * state capacity * leadership

## Framework 

Demographics 
- over 60s more vulnerable 
- male more vulnerable 
- youngest more likely to spread? 
- BAME more vulnerable (hh structure, poverty, type of jobs) 
- multigenerational hhs more vulnerable (old at risk alongside younger spreaders) 

- those with pre-existing conditions more vulnerable: 
	* life expectancy ~ prevalence of heart and lung problems 
	* deaths from respiratory diseases 


Urban/area 
- denser areas ~ easier spread
- public transport networks ~ usage 
- crowded living conditions ~ hh overcrowding 


Economic 
- More exposed jobs (can’t be done at home) 
- More essential jobs (not furloughed, businesses don’t shut) 
- Extent of actual working at home (labour market agency) 
~> behaviour change; mobility response 


Policy 
- speed / extent of shutdown 
- any localised measures, eg TFL changes


Health 
- raw cases? 
- cases per population? [Kolko 2020: deaths per capita; Furth 2020: cases per 1000 people]
- case growth over some time period, logged in regressions [Furth 2020]
- share of positive tests [Almagro and OH 2020]

- !! testing differs across areas in England too, so you need to include some test data from somewhere

## Data + build 

Compare across LAs
Taking into account when LAs are part of a bigger city-region

APS 2018 and 2013 
ASHE 2018/2019 
Census 2011
ONS MYEs 2018 
ONS boundaries / area types 


PHE 
- # cases OR cases per 1k, cases per 100k <No, this smoothes for population and popdensity>
- days since 5th case ~ when it started

!! Replace PHE data with ONS data on actual number of deaths by cause?


census to phe crosswalk 
- UTLAs = 2019 counties, metropolitan counties, inner and outer London, unitary authorities
- 2011 census data you've pulled is pre-2015 unitaries, counties, met counties, i/o london and all LADs 
- lookup using areacodes 
- crosswalk: 
* UTLA Dorset [E06000059] = UAcounty E10000009
* UTLA Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole [E06000058] = E06000028

- % soc10 9xgroups 	[aps]

Policy 
- london / TFL dummy (as alt to cr dummy) 
- other CR dummies, if cities did something different???

## implementation 

Time series of case growth 
- all?
- City-regions vs rest of England average 
- Try: all, with urban LAs vs rest (ONS classification) 


Correlation matrix for all / ! groups / ! channels 


Scatters / binscatter for cases vs dem/urban/econ


Regress in blocs 
- raw cases 
- cases per ...? <No, this smoothes for population and popdensity>
- day 1, day 15, day 30

cluster by LA


Show as: mix of tables and binscatter


Robustness: 
* drop London
* drop other CRs
